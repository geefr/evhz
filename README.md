Show mouse refresh rate under linux + evdev

For information about polling rate, see https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Mouse_Polling_Rate

Just do ./run (run is very short and readable).

Nonverbose mode = -n, but you probably don't want that.

Reported average is for the last 64 samples, or as many as we have so far.

There exists a kernel bug for USB ports which use the uhci_hcd driver,
where a 1000 hz mouse will only read at 500hz, causing jittering:
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=60586. A workaround is to
use USB ports that use the ehci-pci driver.
